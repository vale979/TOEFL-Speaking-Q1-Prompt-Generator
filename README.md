# TOEFL-Speaking-Q1-Prompt-Generator
Just a prompt generator for TOEFL iBT speaking with timer for prep and speaking

## Usage
Open the Front.html file (too lazy to rename it into something like "index.html" lol, do it yourself and change every occurence of that in the script). Don't forget to write your prompt into randomizer.js. I use cloud bootstrap js file so it needs internet connection
